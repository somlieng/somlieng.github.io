			            <p>Jane couldn’t afford to go to college. So she worked. When she was 22, she got invited by her friend Clo to come stay on her family’s new farm in Kenya. Jane was ecstatic and saved up all her money for the round trip passage to Kenya.</p>

			            <p>She set sail in 1957 and arrived in Mombasa on April 2nd. A few weeks afterwards, she meets Louis B. Leakey. He is a famous archaeologist and paleontologist who was interested in studying about evolution. He was impressed by Jane's energy, interest, and knowledge in animals. He hired her as his assistant and secretary at the Coryndon Museum. Soon, she and another student were helping him and his anthropologist wife, Mary Leakey, dig up fossils in the Olduvai Gorge. </p>

			        <div class="bio">
			            <p>At that time, Leakey was looking for someone to go to Tanzania to study chimpanzees. They were a mystery at the time. Studying them would be fascinating and might provide clues about evolution. Louis offers this chance to Jane and she agrees. Jane goes to Tanzania in 1960 with her mother. British authorities resisted the idea of a young woman living among wild animals in Africa alone.</p>

By her discovery, the scientific world had to define what it meant to be human. </p>

					As she wasn't dictated by traditional scientific training, she conducted her research using unorthodox methods. Her most known was that she named her apes rather than numbering them. These included:

			        <ul>
			            <li>David Greybeard - a grey-chinned male who first warmed up to Jane. He was the one that Jane observed making tools to "fish" for termites</li>
			            <li>Goliath - a friend of David Greybeard, who used to be the alpha male of the clan</li>
			            <li>Mike - who displaced Goliath through his cunning plans</li>
			            <li>Humprey - a male bully</li>
			            <li>Gigi - a sterile female who was delighted to be any young chimps' or humans' "aunt"</li>
			            <li>Mr. McGregor - an aggressive older man</li>
			            <li>Flo - a matriach of the 'F' clan. Her children were Figan, Faben, Freud, Frodo, Fifi, and Flint</li>

					Jane discovered that a chimp's life wasn't always peaceful. Sucession of alphas caused much drama. Some females kill other chimp's babies. There was even a four-year "war" during 1974. But these violent moments were accompanied by touching moments. Chimpanzees offer each other hugs, kisses, tickles, and pats on the back.

						Jane Goodall's work transformed the way we understand the relationship of humans and animals. She is the first member of the "Trimates", the founding mothers of Primatology, who include Dian Fossey and Birtue Galdikas. Her pioneering work in Tanzania broke gender norms and led the way for many other female scientist to be able to work in exotic locations. She revolutionary work showed that, provided the opportunity, anyone can make vanguard discoveries.
