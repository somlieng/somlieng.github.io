			            Jane couldn’t afford to go to college. So she worked. When she was 22, she got invited by her friend Clo to come stay on her family’s new farm in Kenya. Jane had always wanted to go to the continent of Africa after reading the story “Dr. Dolittle” by Hugh Lofting, which is a story about a doctor who could speak to animals and traveled to the continent of Africa and goes on numerous adventures. Jane was ecstatic and saved up all her money for the round trip passage to Kenya.

			            She set sail in 1957 and arrived in Mombasa on April 2nd. A few weeks afterwards, she meets Louis B. Leakey. He is a famous archaeologist and paleontologist who was interested in studying about evolution. He was impressed by Jane's energy, interest, and knowledge in animals. He hired her as his assistant and secretary at the Coryndon Museum. Soon, she and another student were helping him and his anthropologist wife, Mary Leakey, dig up fossils in the Olduvai Gorge.

			        <div class="bio">
			            At that time, Leakey was looking for someone to go to Tanzania to study chimpanzees. They were a mystery at the time. Studying them would be fascinating and might provide clues about evolution. Louis offers this chance to Jane and she agrees. Jane goes to Tanzania in 1960 with her mother. British authorities resisted the idea of a young woman living among wild animals in Africa alone.
